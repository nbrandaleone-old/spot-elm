port module spot-elm exposing (..)
{-| TodoMVC implemented in Elm, using plain HTML and CSS for rendering.

This application is broken up into three key parts:

  1. Model  - a full definition of the application's state
  2. Update - a way to step the application state forward
  3. View   - a way to visualize our application state with HTML

This clean division of concerns is a core part of Elm. You can read more about
this in <http://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/index.html>
